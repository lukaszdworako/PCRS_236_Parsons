TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

tests.txt contains comma-separated lines, one line per test.
The first value is the url of the page to be tested.
If the second value is unspecified, then the page will be issued a get request.
If the second value is specified, the test will issue a post request,
lookup the file with that name, and post its content as data.

NOTE:
At the current state, the csrf protection needs to be disabled to run post tests.

You can specify the number of users, and the number of concurrent connections
for every test. Only tests with greater or equal number of concurrent
connection than the number of users are run.
When all the test for a url are finished, you will get a report table printed.
Rows corresponds to a number of users, and columns to the number of concurrent
connections, lowest to highest, based on the values set in the tests.
Every value in the table is a tuple, where the first value is the mean request
time, and the second is mean request time across concurrent connections as
reporte by apache bench.

Note, that if a page returns a 200 status, or transfers no html, it is
considered an error. This is because, at the moment, the requests to pages we
want to test should never return a non-200 status, this would be an error.
